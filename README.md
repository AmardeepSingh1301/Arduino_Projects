# Soil Moisture Sensor
**About Project**
This is an Ardunio UNO project which is use to monitor the moisture present in the soil and irrigate the target (pot, field) when the moisture gets too low.
There is an ESP 8266 module use to keep you update with the moisture reading using Thinkspeak cloud service which can be accessed from any part of the world.
In this project we used a pot with moisture reading set as:-
1. 0 to 500 (High Moisture).
2. 500 to 750 (Perfect Moisture).
3. 750 and Above (Low Moisture).
